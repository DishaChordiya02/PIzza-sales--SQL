Welcome to the Pizza Sales SQL Project! This repository contains a SQL-based project designed to analyze and manage pizza sales data. 
The project includes four main tables: orders, pizzas, pizza_types, and order_details. 
The Pizza Sales SQL Project aims to facilitate the analysis of pizza sales data by organizing it into a relational database. 
This repository provides the SQL scripts needed to create the database schema, populate it with sample data, and perform various queries to extract meaningful insights.
